Focusing on text classification task, we are motivated to address the following two fundamental research questions (RQs):

\begin{description}
    \item[RQ1:] \emph{Does state-of-the-art attack methods generate adversarial examples that are legible, grammatical, and similar in meaning to the original texts?}
    \item[RQ2:] \emph{How can we craft high-quality adversaries?}
\end{description}
