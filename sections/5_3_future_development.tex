A promising direction for future work is to extend SynBA to other NLP tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and text summarization.
In this dissertation we mainly focused on sentiment analysis, but the proposed method can be easily adapted to work with different scenarios. 

Another interesting improvement would be to add a new constraint which penalizes the use of words that lead to a contradiction with the original text.

Additionally, enhancing language models to generate more semantically related perturbations can be one possible solution to perfect SynBA in the future.
