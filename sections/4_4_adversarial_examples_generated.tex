\section{Adversarial examples generated}\label{sec:adversarial-examples-generated}
%**************************************************************

Sometimes the proposed metrics are not enough to evaluate the quality of the generated adversarial examples. 
Taking a look at the perturbation generated by each underlined attack on the same input text could give a better understanding of how each method affects the original text.

Table \ref{tab:adversarial_examples_generated} compares the adversarial examples generated by the proposed method, TextFooler, and BAE starting from the same input text.
While the outputs crafted by BAE are often inconsistent, TextFooler sometimes substitutes the original word with a synonym not properly adapted to the context (e.g. in the fourth example, “moments” becomes “min”).
The proposed method, instead, generates perturbations that are semantically consistent with the original text and in the last example, it “rightly” fails differently from the other two attacks that result in incoherent sentences.
