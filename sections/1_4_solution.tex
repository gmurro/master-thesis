% Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
% • We propose a simple but strong baseline, TEXTFOOLER, to quickly generate high-profile utility-preserving adversarial examples that force the target models to make wrong predictions under the black-box setting.
% • We evaluate TEXTFOOLER on three state-of-the-art deep learning models over five popular text classification tasks and two textual entailment tasks, and it achieved the state-of-the-art attack success rate and perturbation rate. Algorithm 1 Adversarial Attack by TEXTFOOLER
% • We propose a comprehensive four-way automatic and three-way human evaluation of language adversarial attacks to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and utilitypreserving properties of our system.
% • We open-source the code, pre-trained target models, and test samples for the convenience of future benchmarking
