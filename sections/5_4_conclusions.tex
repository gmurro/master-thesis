\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
%**************************************************************


Our hope is that this work encourages readers to think more carefully about appropriate perturbations to text which do not change meaning of sentences.
We believe that the proposed method is a step forward in the direction of generating adversarial texts that are semantically consistent with the original texts.

Having better adversarial attacks is important for the development of robust NLP systems. 
The awareness that NLP models are far from perfect should push towards the intensive study of these Adversarial Machine Learning techniques to improve security in this field.
