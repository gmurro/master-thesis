These carefully curated examples are correctly classified by a human observer but can fool a target model, raising serious concerns regarding the security and integrity of existing ML algorithms. On the other hand, it is showed that robustness and generalization of ML models can be improved by crafting high-quality adversaries and including them in the training data.
