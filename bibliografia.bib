  abstract = {The abundant volume of natural language text in the connected world, though having a large content of knowledge, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to disseminate it by a human to discover the knowledge/wisdom in it, specifically within any given time limits. The automated NLP is aimed to do this job effectively and with accuracy, like a human does it (for a limited of amount text). This chapter presents the challenges of NLP, progress so far made in this field, NLP applications, components of NLP, and grammar of English language---the way machine requires it. In addition, covers the specific areas like probabilistic parsing, ambiguities and their resolution, information extraction, discourse analysis, NL question-answering, commonsense interfaces, commonsense thinking and reasoning, causal-diversity, and various tools for NLP. Finally, the chapter summary, and a set of relevant exercises are presented.},

	abstract = {With the growing availability and popularity of online reviews, the sentiment analysis arises in response to the requirement of organizing useful information in speed. Feature selection directly affects the representation of online reviews and brings a lot of challenges to the domain of sentiment analysis. However, little attention has been paid to feature selection of Chinese online reviews so far. Therefore, we are motivated to explore the effects of feature selection on sentiment analysis of Chinese online reviews. Firstly, N-char-grams and N-POS-grams are selected as the potential sentimental features. Then, the improved Document Frequency method is used to select feature subsets, and the Boolean Weighting method is adopted to calculate feature weight. At last, experiments based on online reviews of mobile phone are conducted, and Chi-square test is carried out to test the significance of experimental results. The results suggest that sentiment analysis of Chinese online reviews obtains higher accuracy when taking 4-POS-grams as features. Besides that, low order N-char-grams can achieve a better performance than high order N-char-grams when taking N-char-grams as features. Furthermore, the improved document frequency achieves significant improvement in sentiment analysis of Chinese online reviews.},

This information is traditionally provided through dictionaries, and machine-readable dictionaries are now widely available. But dictionary entries evolved for the convenience of human readers, not for machines. WordNet1 provides a more effective combination of traditional lexicographic information and modern computing. WordNet is an online lexical database designed for use under program control. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into sets of synonyms, each representing a lexicalized concept. Semantic relations link the synonym sets [4].},

  abstract = {Several machine learning models, including neural networks, consistently
misclassify adversarial examples---inputs formed by applying small but
intentionally worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such that
the perturbed input results in the model outputting an incorrect answer with
high confidence. Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on
nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural
networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature.
This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the
first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization
across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and
fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide
examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout
network on the MNIST dataset.},

@article{szegedy2013intriguing,
  abstract = {Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently achieved
state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While
their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn
uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this
paper we report two such properties.
  First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level
units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various
methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the
individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers
of neural networks.
  Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that
are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to
misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is
found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific
nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same
perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different
subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many fields due to their powerful representation learning capabilities. However, they are exposed to serious threats caused by the increasing security issues. Adversarial examples were early discovered in computer vision (CV) field when the models were fooled by perturbing the original inputs, and they also exist in natural language processing (NLP) community. However, unlike the image, the text is discrete and semantic in nature, making the generation of adversarial attacks even more difficult. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of adversarial attacks and defenses in the textual domain. First, we introduce the pipeline of NLP, including the vector representations of text, DNN-based victim models, and a formal definition of adversarial attacks, which makes our review self-contained. Second, we propose a novel taxonomy for the existing adversarial attacks and defenses, which is fine-grained and closely aligned with practical applications. Finally, we summarize and discuss the major existing issues and further research directions of text adversarial attacks and defenses.},

abstract = {Recently, the adversarial attack and defense technology has made remarkable achievements and has been widely applied in the computer vision field, promoting its rapid development in other fields, primarily the natural language processing domain. However, discrete semantic texts bring additional restrictions and challenges to successfully implementing adversarial attacks and defenses. This survey systematically summarizes the current progress of adversarial techniques in the natural language processing field. We first briefly introduce the textual adversarial example’s particularity, vectorization, and evaluation metrics. More importantly, we categorize textual adversarial attacks according to the combination of semantic granularity and example generation strategy. Next, we present commonly used datasets and adversarial attack applications in diverse natural language processing tasks. Besides, we classify defense strategies as passive and active methods considering both input data and victim models. Finally, we present several challenging issues and future research directions in this domain.}
