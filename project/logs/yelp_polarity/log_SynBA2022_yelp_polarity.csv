It was very hard to hand over my portion of the bill when at home I can <font color = green>proceed</font> down the <font color = green>sidewalk</font> and order a 16oz Ribeye that comes with a baked potato and side salad for $9.95 (and it's the <font color = green>exemplary</font> damn <font color = green>sandwich</font> I've ever had); I actually went there when I flew in to cheer up. \n\nOut of 5 of us only one liked their dinner; which happened to be the bachelorette so we were happy. Another one of us ordered the beef tartar and it came with something like bagel chips instead of a sliced baguette. When she asked the server if they had a sliced baguette she looked at her like she was insane; left for <font color = green>probably</font> a minute and then came back saying \""""they just couldn't do it\"""".  VERY <font color = green>RUDD</font>! \n\nWe ended up taking our leftovers <font color = green>expected</font> we would see a <font color = green>stray</font> person to give them to. \n\nWe also thought it was ironic that the owner of this restaurant is so judgemental on his show, yet this was a <font color = green>dire</font> <font color = green>feast</font>.",0.00015628337860107422,0.8100447058677673,0,1,0,245,"Successful"

"I just moved here from out of state (grew up near nyc), and after living here for a few months I've <font color = green>decided</font> this is one of my favorite <font color = green>restaurants</font> in <font color = green>Madison</font>. There's a few reasons why:\n\n1. I'll start off with the fact that this place has far-and-away the best cheese curds I've tasted yet. Granted I'm not a Wisconsin native, but I can appreciate good food when I see it. The Old Fashioned's curds are the tastiest, gooiest, squeakiest, and have the <font color = green>best</font> texture of anywhere else I've been. They're a must-have, hands down.\n\n2. The <font color = green>atmosphere</font> is perfect.

The energy in the place is always <font color = green>happy</font>, probably attributable to point #1.\n\n3. The beer.

The biggest thing is that their selection is almost entirely Wisconsin-local beers. I love that, even though (and maybe especially because) I'm from out of state. Their presentation (on giant <font color = green>slabs</font> of wood) for the beer flights is pretty awesome, too.\n\n4. The food I've had there is the only thing I <font color = green>might</font> hesitate on for the 5-star <font color = green>rating</font> (I'd have preferred to give a 4.5). I love their Wurst Platter (which can easily feed 3 people for about $15), and some of their burgers are very good, but I've found the food to be extremely rich and hard to take more than a few bites of.

You probably already know the answer.\n\nRed Dragon Roll: ..... I would review this if we actually got to eat it. Back to Jamie M's review. It is now 55 minutes after we ordered.

"YOUR GUIDE TO A <font color = green>SUCCESSFUL</font> FLAMINGO HOTEL STAY\n\nAfter pretty much reading nothing but negative reviews I think I need to share what I think makes for a great Flamingo Hotel experience.  We have done an annual man-cation here for the last 4 years in July and  I don't have a single complaint and below are a couple reasons why.  I do understand the Flamingo can be a little difficult to navigate and in some aspects has kind of turned into a In and Out Burger type establishment where you need to know the secret menu but here is your secret menu:\n\n1.  This is the FLAMINGO so you are already setting yourself up for failure if you go in expecting the Wynn or some other fancy hotel I have only seen the outside of.  Wrap your head around that before booking at this hotel.  I am not someone who subscribes to the theory of just getting a crap hotel because you are never in it.  I want a good bed and nice shower even if I do plan on being in the room 6 hours over the course of 3 days.  You can still get a quality room at the Flamingo if you know what you are doing\n\n2.  BOOKING A ROOM:\nWhen you get a room spend the extra money and get a Go Room.  Don't pay for the <font color = green>upgrade</font> for the rooms with the crap fake wood floor.  A Go Room I say.  Don't pay for a suite unless you are already in a gambling mood.  Some can be great and others can look like an apartment circa 1972.  Getting a standard room is like asking for your room to smell of cat urine and vomit.  Again if you are in the gambling mood give it a whirl.  The Go Rooms are clean for the most part and modern.  Good shower and bed with an I pod docking station for listening to good jams before you go out.\n\n3.  CHECKING IN:\nThis can be a <font color = green>cluster</font> mess of epic proportion if you allow it but follow this method and you will be good to go and laughing at the individuals in line for hours having a breakdown. We do this every year and have not had a problem yet.  First, DO NOT arrive at check in time and actually do not check in after 1pm ever.  Figure out a way to get there early.  Last year we tried to check in at 8am.  Of course we couldn't but that is not the point.  If you are flying to Vegas have the cab driver drop you off at the Valet and call over a bell hop.  If you drive to Vegas go to the Valet and call over a bell hop.  The bell hop will take your bags and give you a ticket.  First problem already solved.  Now you have just avoided being the people carrying their luggage through the hotel running into trash cans and small children along the way.  The people with their luggage on the Strip are hopeless so forget about them. Now you may be able to check in early for a small fee and if so great, you simply call down when you get to your room and your bags arrive and everybody is happy.  Now if you are like us and try to check in at 8am this is never going to work but what you will do is knock out everything that is needed with the front desk so when you come back at 3pm or whenever you go into a different line.  A few minutes an then you get your room key and are done because you have already completed the credit card/ID crap.  When you try and check in too early at the front desk they will point out this separate line for you to get in later in the day.\n\n4.  The POOL:  First of all RIP to the small pool which used to be the 21 and over pool and was topless at one time.  Nobody actually went topless, well a few people did but you get the idea.  So the large pool is 21 and up and the small pool is for families.  Families this hotel is really not the place for you.  You might think the location is great but I have about a million reasons why you should not stay here with the little ones. The Flamingo pool scene is good times and it is not the whole Encore pool scene vibe.  Get there early really early if you are the kind of person who wants a chair.  Remember this pool is also open to Bill's guest as well so the chairs fill up quick.  We usually pay the $200 and get the day bed for the day and there you have a home base to place your things, sit, lay or whatever you little heart desires.  It comes with a couple of free drinks or a bucket of beers.  You are in direct line for the booty shaking contest in the afternoon as well.  It is kind of cheesy but everyone is having a good time so just cheer for the brave girls who get up there and shake that thang.   The pool is big enough so although everyone is peeing it really does not effect you or at least me. I will say the vibe at the pool was a little weak this past year.  I thought the DJ just turned it to the local FM top 40 station and called it a day.  I am not trying to hate at all but the crowd did look a little rough around the edges.  You know what I am talking about.  Some really LARGE white people with their umbrella drink in one hand and a basket of whatever nasty mess they ordered at the snack shop in the other.  Still plenty of good looking people.  Hope this helps","YOUR GUIDE TO A <font color = red>GRATIFYING</font> FLAMINGO HOTEL STAY\n\nAfter pretty much reading nothing but negative reviews I think I need to share what I think makes for a great Flamingo Hotel experience.

CHECKING IN:\nThis can be a <font color = red>bundled</font> mess of epic proportion if you allow it but follow this method and you will be good to go and laughing at the individuals in line for hours having a breakdown. We do this every year and have not had a problem yet.  First, DO NOT arrive at check in time and actually do not check in after 1pm ever.  Figure out a way to get there early.  Last year we tried to check in at 8am.  Of course we couldn't but that is not the point.  If you are flying to Vegas have the cab driver drop you off at the Valet and call over a bell hop.  If you drive to Vegas go to the Valet and call over a bell hop.  The bell hop will take your bags and give you a ticket.  First problem already solved.  Now you have just avoided being the people carrying their luggage through the hotel running into trash cans and small children along the way.  The people with their luggage on the Strip are hopeless so forget about them. Now you may be able to check in early for a small fee and if so great, you simply call down when you get to your room and your bags arrive and everybody is happy.  Now if you are like us and try to check in at 8am this is never going to work but what you will do is knock out everything that is needed with the front desk so when you come back at 3pm or whenever you go into a different line.  A few minutes an then you get your room key and are done because you have already completed the credit card/ID crap.  When you try and check in too early at the front desk they will point out this separate line for you to get in later in the day.\n\n4.  The POOL:  First of all RIP to the small pool which used to be the 21 and over pool and was topless at one time.  Nobody actually went topless, well a few people did but you get the idea.  So the large pool is 21 and up and the small pool is for families.  Families this hotel is really not the place for you.  You might think the location is great but I have about a million reasons why you should not stay here with the little ones. The Flamingo pool scene is good times and it is not the whole Encore pool scene vibe.  Get there early really early if you are the kind of person who wants a chair.  Remember this pool is also open to Bill's guest as well so the chairs fill up quick.  We usually pay the $200 and get the day bed for the day and there you have a home base to place your things, sit, lay or whatever you little heart desires.  It comes with a couple of free drinks or a bucket of beers.  You are in direct line for the booty shaking contest in the afternoon as well.  It is kind of cheesy but everyone is having a good time so just cheer for the brave girls who get up there and shake that thang.   The pool is big enough so although everyone is peeing it really does not effect you or at least me. I will say the vibe at the pool was a little weak this past year.  I thought the DJ just turned it to the local FM top 40 station and called it a day.  I am not trying to hate at all but the crowd did look a little rough around the edges.  You know what I am talking about.  Some really LARGE white people with their umbrella drink in one hand and a basket of whatever nasty mess they ordered at the snack shop in the other.  Still plenty of good looking people.  Hope this helps",0.008288145065307617,0.5559362173080444,1,0,1,66,"Successful"

"You'd think, wouldn't you, that with a name like Hillside Spot this restaurant in Ahwatukee would be nestled in a pastoral setting with lovely views? Not so, it's in a typical strip mall off Warner Rd. and unfortunately its patio faces directly on the street, making it hard to carry on a conversation, even on a Sunday. The patio, without misters, is uninviting, with a very odd mixture of seat cushions for the wrought iron furniture.

Ken opted for the Derby Salad, with various greens, egg, avocado, bacon, and blue cheese, served with house made buttermilk dressing ($8). We waited quite a while, when finally a server, <font color = red>shouting</font> our name and number, delivered our food. The salad was good size, with loads of blue cheese chunks of good quality (rather than the generic crumbles served at many places), and large pieces of bacon. The greens were <font color = red>fresh</font> and the avocado looked freshly cubed. It's a shame that the buttermilk dressing was tasteless, and the quantity skimpy.

I tried all 4 BBq sauces and didn't like any of them, especially disliked the vinegar sauce! \nOverall it is the worst food I have eaten at a Madison <font color = red>lunch</font> in years! Not sure why <font color = red>manager</font> changed everything but they completely lost my business!

"MY <font color = red>RATING</font> HAS TO DO WITH THE SERVICE NOT THE FOOD. THE FOOD <font color = red>WOULD</font> GET 5 STARS EASILY!\n\nStarting off positive, the food was excellent! I ordered the Roasted Chili Glaze wings and they were, BY FAR, the best I have ever had! The other guests in my party ordered the Hot, Honey, and Hoppy wings, and the Southwest Americana burger. I tried both of those, and they were delicious. The wings had a nice kick to them without being overwhelming and the burger was the same way. The goat cheese balanced out the gigantic, fried pepper perfectly. QUALITY ingredients and well sized portions. For the food only, I will be visiting again.\n\nNow for the <font color = red>reason</font> I gave a 2-star <font color = red>rating</font>. It was a busy afternoon because of the ASU vs U of A game, so I figured service might take a little longer than normal. However, the amount of time we waited and the lack of attention our waiter gave to us was not what it should have been even with it being busy.\n\nWe started off ordering beers and that came out to us at a reasonable time. Then our waiter, Scott, took our order. We put in for the wings, burgers, and an appetizer (chips and salsa) to start us off. After 10-12 minutes of waiting I started to look for Scott walking around the restaurant to grab his attention and ask for our chips, but he was no where to be found. And the few times I caught a glimpse of him walking around, he never visited our table. Our meal took about 18 minutes or so to come out, which was fine wit me, but he never gave us our appetizer or even acknowledged that he forgot it. \n\nAbout 10 minutes into dinner, one of my guest's wanted a refill for the beer but again, our waiter was no where around. When he finally came to our table about 3 minutes later, another one of my guest's asked for a water (that he forgot to bring from the beginning) and before the guest who wanted a beer could even ask, Scott walked away too fast to even get a word out. By that time, we just had our mind on getting the check. \n\nIt took another 10 minutes to get the check processed because Scott hadn't come back to get our check, so we gave it to another waitress to get it done. Overall, we felt like we were the guests shoved into the corner and forgotten about. In my opinion, there were not enough staff working for how many people were there. That could have attributed to the lack of service and minimal attention needed to serve our table.","MY <font color = green>ESTIMATING</font> HAS TO DO WITH THE SERVICE NOT THE FOOD.

"I came to this place because its close to my home and I know someone that went here and her hair turned out nice so I tried it out. I initially wanted to get highlights and cut I showed the receptionist a picture and the hairstylist. I basically told her this is what I want.

To be <font color = red>honest</font> with you I have never paid that much to get my hair done. Anyways, she told me before she starts that I have to sign this paper to pretty much <font color = red>proves</font> that I agree that I'm paying $175. So when she started she cut my hair first which turned out <font color = red>ok</font>. Because I usually just get my trim before doing anything. <font color = red>Then</font> after that she started showing me swatches on what she thought my hair would look nice in. I showed her the picture of how I want the color again and she kept on <font color = red>insisting</font> on chili when The picture looks like blonde brown and light <font color = red>brown</font>. I told her I want what I see in the picture.. <font color = red>After</font> a <font color = red>long</font> process of being in the dryer and washer I thought that the color is <font color = red>finally</font> <font color = red>showing</font> up because she showed a little bit if the <font color = red>strip</font> of my hair. Long story short, <font color = red>nothing</font> changed! I got the hair cut! She offered me products and I bought one! But the color stayed the same from when I came in. I <font color = red>love</font> how she went step by step before she did my hair and she said in time it will slowly lighten but honesty I paid $200+ to make my hair look like something got done and it was such <font color = red>waste</font>.

First of all.. I didn't even talk to this person at all. I saw him go in and out of the salon and that was it anyways, And My hair no black!! Long story short.  He told me to come in and they can fix my hair and he apologized with the situation because he realized that i wasn't that client that he supposedly talk too. When I came in, The hair stylist wasn't there  yet.. So i waited 15 mins. for her to get in. When she got it in... She has this Nasty attitude, like she didn't want to fix my hair. So i told her what I wanted and the color didn't show up. She still kept on insisting that it will fade over time. But no way im gonna wait a couple of weeks for my hair to fade and i paid 200+ to get my hair done! Get the hell out of here! Anyways, She finally started fixing my hair. She still had this nasty attitude towards me while she was fixing my hair but the hair was done and she fixed it. I love how the color turned out, it just like the picture that i showed her initially! I gave her another $20/tip .. mind you i gave her $20/tip the week before and i gave her another tip this visit.  I love how it turned out and i gave her my business card for work. I told her that I will call her in a few months to get a touch up. So that was for her to keep! Few days later... Sebastian started calling my work!! Like WTF!! It wasn't once.. it was about 5 times what my co workers told me at least. He said to call me back ASAP! What the hell... I gave the Hair stylist my business card for her to keep. So we can keep in touch for business... And sebastian starts calling my work like a maniac! None The less! The experienced with this Salon was supposed to turn around to a good review until Sebastian started to Call my work! How unprofessional! That is worst than a debt collector! NEVER AGAIN!

"A few weeks ago, my husband saw online that there was a corgi here available for adoption. We own 2 Corgis and decided to go down and see if we could meet her. We brought our older Corgi with us and arrived about an hour before they closed. It was pretty crowded, but it was nice to see that many people were interested in adopting animals. One thing I recommend is to look at their website and know the names of the animals you are interested in, because the volunteers will ask you:\na. Have you looked at our adoptable animals on our website?\nb. Do you know which ones you would like to meet?\n\nThere were 2 potential owners who were meeting the Corgi when we got there. One of the volunteers told us that we were welcome to wait and see if she's going to get adopted. If not, we would be next in line to meet her. The first lady walked out. The second lady spent a while with her, so we thought she would be adopted for sure. Then, I heard her say \""""sorry\"""" to the volunteer and walked out.\n\nWe finally got to meet her and she was very sweet. 7 years old, in pretty good health, but obviously neglected and left on the streets for who knows how long. Her nails were extremely long. I wish they had cut her nails in the first place. But, I understand, they probably have so many animals coming in and not enough volunteers so they must be extremely busy. She also had hair missing from the back of her ears. Possibly from a food allergy or ear infection that never got treated. Looks like she may have gotten into a few fights on the streets because tiny chunks of her ears were missing as well. My guess is, these were the main reasons why the other ladies did not want to adopt her. So sad that they didn't want to give this poor girl a chance! But on the other hand, it is a good thing they walked away. What the NSPCA wants are people who will provide \""""forever homes\"""" for the animals, and if they can't commit to that, the animals are better off waiting for someone who will.\n\nYes, we adopted her and are now one big happy family! We had a very good experience here. Friendly and knowledgeable volunteers, affordable adoption fees and they even have a play area outside if you want to bring your dogs in and see if they get along. \n\nCheers to those who support Nevada SPCA!","A few weeks ago, my husband saw online that there was a corgi here available for adoption.

"When you pay PRIME prices you <font color = red>expect</font> PRIME service and PRIME food. This was at least our fifth <font color = red>visit</font> to PRIME and very <font color = red>likely</font> our <font color = red>last</font>.\n\nWe have celebrated birthdays and anniversaries at PRIME and on December 23, 2010 were looking for a quiet getaway and a splurge on dinner with perfect service as we had enjoyed in the past. We arrived at our reservation time. Our prior request for a table by the window was not honored but it was a nice table and we were happy when we were seated. In all past visits I would have given PRIME a five star rating. We ordered drinks and appetizers. We soon noticed that the highly attentive, though not imposing service we have come to love and expect at PRIME was not present. Drinks took over 10 minutes and bread took 20. The shrimp <font color = red>cocktail</font> was amazing as usual, keeping in mind that 4 shrimp for $20 ought to be amazing. \n\nWe each ordered the Baby <font color = red>Iceberg</font> Lettuce with Crispy Bacon & Maytag Bleu Cheese Dressing. This was served about 30 minutes into our visit. (By then my husband was ready for another drink and started trying to catch someone's eye to request one. Our waiter was occupied with the table of 5 seated next to us. Finally my husband asked someone else for another drink. It took at least 15-20 more minutes for the drink to arrive and the person who brought it was not our waiter and not until after we had complained to the manager.) For $18 each you might expect some interesting salad presentation. I enjoyed eating the salad but not the fact that I had to cut the lettuce myself. It looked like they had just cut a center slice of the baby lettuce head and plopped it on a plate. My husband thought the salad was too rich as there were blue cheese chunks and heavy blue cheese dressing along with very thick bacon. \n\nFor the main course we each ordered the small filet mignon $44 for 8oz. These don't come with any side dishes so we also ordered sides of potatoes and mushrooms to share. We had been there about an hour by now and my drink was empty, our waters were <font color = red>empty</font> and our waiter was now taking an order at a third table. I asked a staff member passing by if I could please speak to a manager. The General Manager came right to our table. I told her we were sad that the service was so <font color = red>poor</font> and that our waiter seemed not to have time for us. My husband still did not have the second drink. The Manager was extremely polite and said she was very sorry and that she would take care of things. This did get things going -- though we did not like to have to complain to get decent service. My husband's second drink came a minute after she walked away. Then the filet were served but again not by our waiter. I suspect they had been sitting \""""up\"""" for a while. The filet were cold to the touch but each had two small charred green chili peppers sizzling next to them. The charred pepper smell was overpowering to the point that it hit the sinus right as they lifted off the silver cover.  Within that same minute sides were delivered. We got the mushrooms but instead of potatoes, we got creamed spinach. \n\nThat was it. The dinner we had been looking forward to for months was ruined. Since neither of us like hot peppers or spinach, we decided to leave. I asked for the manager again and told her that we needed to leave as the wrong side and hot peppers along with the poor service had ruined our dinner. I asked her to please charge what we had eaten up to that point to our room, but she declined to do so. She was very empathetic and offered to reseat us and start over or send whatever we wanted back to our room. This was a kind offer but we were just not up for either as our experience was ruined. By then it was around 9pm and we were just tired of trying to beg for service in what is supposed to be a four star place. \n\nAfter many good dinners and fond memories of the exceptionally fine service, superior food and decor as well as the beautiful view of the fountains, I don't think we will go back.

"I have always been a BIG fan of Sushi Kee. When I found out they bought out Zushi, I was <font color = red>thrilled</font>!! As I live about 2 minutes away from Zushi. Boy, was I, and <font color = red>continue</font> to be <font color = red>disappointed</font>. Here are just a few examples of why I'm not too fond of Zushi.\n\nFirst, my friend and I went there a few weekends ago and we are both pregnant. I usually get the Apache Roll, under different circumstances. The Apache roll is basically a California roll with spicy mayo on top, white fish on top and baked. So, I asked if they could make me a California roll, but put the spicy mayo on top and bake it for me. Keep in mind, Sushi Kee does this for me EVERY TIME I GO. The waiter told me they couldn't do that but they could substitute the fish. So, I ok'd and just asked to put shrimp on top instead. Well, 20 minutes later, he comes out with two California rolls, the way I requested, but with NO fish on top what so ever. Mind you, I asked for ONE regular California roll and ONE Apache style. It bothered me that he didn't even come out and tell me that they weren't going to substitute the fish AND the fact that he didn't check my order. So, I got charged FULL price for 2 Apache rolls. When, in fact, they were not Apache rolls. When confronted about it he said, \""""well, we would have to charge you 3$ anyway for the spicy mayo and to bake it so i figured I would just charge you the full price for the Apache.\"""" How does this make sense? A California roll is 4$ maybe 5$? and an Apache is almost 10$. ANYWAY, he did not care what so ever. Oh and when we were bone dry on our drinks, we look over, and he's sitting at the end of the bar just watching some <font color = red>TV</font>. It took him a good 7 minutes to come back to the table to check on us. Needless to say, I have never tipped that horrible, EVER.\n\nA different friend of mine and I decided to go again. We both live so close so it's convenient. The waitress was wearing this TINY <font color = red>little</font> <font color = red>skirt</font>. Literally, you could see things when she walked away from the table. About the service she gave, it was way better than anyone else working there! Touche to her! However, the food ... eh okay. Now when I go to Zushi I don't EVER ask for any type of specialty rolls because they have made it clear, they don't understand. My friend ordered the teriyaki chicken for her son and the teriyaki sauce was absolutely HORRIBLE. The chicken was decent but looked a little weird. The only thing that really saved this sushi date, was the server, she was one of the best we've had since I started going there!\n\nAll in all, I think their food is pretty good. IF you go to Zushi and find a good server, stick with that one. The service there is just absolutely horrid. If they fired there entire staff and restocked up on some people who actually enjoy their jobs, somewhat, I would go there more often.

"<font color = green>Sushi</font> Koma <font color = green>coma</font>. \n\nWe sit at the sushi bar and the servers got us with drinks, some edamame and started a appetizer order for us. Where we sat at the bar, there is a sign and a plate blocking so we were hard to see, but for a while weren't really being greeted by the sushi chefs or asked if we wanted to order even though they knew we were there. I guess the ladies sensed us shifting after we've eaten most out apps and asked if we wanted to order from them. Eventually we were able to make sushi orders to the chefs, but the servers here are <font color = green>amazingly</font> top notch. Super friendly, attentive and <font color = green>intuitive</font> to diners <font color = green>needs</font> and absolutely should be <font color = green>praised</font> for it. \n\nWe tried - \n\nAPPS \n*sashimi roll- don't <font color = green>think</font> it's the size of a regular roll, it's a bit smaller, with asparagus in the middle and wrapped in white radish and it goes with a sweet sauce (eel I think) and sweet mayo. Personally would have gone without the sweet sauce and maybe done a ponzu instead. Still, pretty interesting and good. \n*tuna carpaccio - peppered tuna slices, some ponzu, mayo and crisp garlic. It's pretty tasty of a combination, though I was unsure of the creaminess at first. \n*seafood toastada- this was tasty with a bit spicy and sweet sauce, chopped fish on a crispy wonton. These are one per person though the menu doesn't state it... I assume the sashimi roll and tuna carpaccio are as well, but we only got to ordering one of each of those.\n*dynamite - It's a guilty pleasure of mine, this was standard but pretty good.\n\nNIGIRI\n*albacore - This was fresh and had a interesting flavor...almost a smoky flavor to it or the sauce. \n*cajun albacore - Now this is cajun <font color = green>indeed</font>! It was rather spicy! This and the regular albacore wasn't on their menu, but we asked and they had it....Perhaps ask what nigiri isn't listed as there are a few you may <font color = green>miss</font>! \n*yellowtail - Theirs was really fresh and served with ponzu and a thin jalapeno slice which was a nice kick. We kept ordering this, the favorite of the night.\n*red snapper- I normally don't like this, but I go back to try once in a while. Here it was rather fresh and enjoyable. \n*scallop- Whole scallop nigiri is one of my favorites. We normally ask in our favorite spot for masago/tobiko on top and a squeeze of yuzu sauce. The scallop was fresh and sweet here, but their yuzu sauce is rather sweet than citrus so I don't know if it has yuzu at all. Iwould order without and maybe do a touch of lemon next time. I generally lean towards tangy flavors than sweet when it comes to sushi.\n*mackerel- One of my favorite things to order, here it was just okay. It was a bit stronger flavor and salty than I would like. \n*uni - Theirs was fresh and sweet! It's a recent acquired taste I'm liking more and more, so I'm sensitive to when it's not fresh and very iodine tasting. I like theirs a lot. \n\nROLL\n*Denver roll - We got this based on it having soft shell crab so I was kinda expecting it to be like a spider roll, with a big crab in it, this had more of it sliced then fried. It was alright, I like the crunch with the shrimp on top and the crab mix. I'm not a roll person normally, but I appreciate their rice ratio in rolls is rather fair. \n*salmon skin handroll- Unlike some places where the skin has a bit a meat, this is pure skin goodness. It makes for a really chip like crisp to it. Theirs has the usual sprouts, cucumber and gobo root, but one thing I've never had is this was also wrapped with some shiso/ perilla leaf in it! I happen to like that taste and enjoyed the flavor combination in this handroll, but it may be strong to some. \n\nDESSERT included is ice cream or mochi. The BF and I shared a green tea ice cream and a mango since it's limit one dessert per person and I must say that I really like their green tea ice cream. Its consistency was rather creamy and smooth and the flavor was a bit floral which I'm a fan of. \n\nOVERALL? I thought the fish was fresh and the food was pretty enjoyable. The service from the servers are some of the best around town. We also got asked toward the end of our meal how we liked the experience which isn't usual and I think shows that they care to strive where they can improve. I presume the friendly guy that chatted us up was the owner or a manager. \n\n I will be back for sure, I work close by and we eat late. For now, this is a step behind my usual late night sushi spot.","<font color = red>Sochi</font> Koma <font color = red>ate</font>. \n\nWe sit at the sushi bar and the servers got us with drinks, some edamame and started a appetizer order for us.

"On the whole, this restaurant does give a new patron a great slice of  European cuisine and it is worth noting that if you've never been here before that you should try it out because most of the food as it is now is delicious, but having been here in the past and knowing what these foods really were has really soured my experience.\n\nIt's been a long time since I had been back to this place since its first inception. Back then this place was one of the only occupied storefronts in a dead strip mall. This place had a menu that was meat and cheese heavy and showcased a wide assortment of Eastern Bloc varieties.\n\nThe appeal of this place in addition to the great food was the tell tale sign of a great hole in the wall joint: Authentic European food, sketchy European groups of men and women engaging in non-English conversation and a woman running the show who knew what was good and made sure you ate it.\n\nThe most notable things were:\n\nShopska salad\n-It has the creamiest Bulgarian feta cheese. Don't mistake this feta for Greek feta. This is incredible.\n\nCevape\n-Homemade fat finger sized sausages served with lepina, a type of yeasty flatbread.\n\nArtisian Charcuterie Plate/Cheese Plate\n-These 2 are definite musts for light eating and drinks\n\nLeskovacka pljeskavica\n-similar to the cevape in flavor but served like an over sized burger\n\nThere were also a few kabob-like meats and a few other sausages similar to the cevape that were so delicious.\n\nSo why the <font color = red>poor</font> rating? Mostly due to the fact that what I described is what I was hoping to find on this most recent visit today.\n\nOur waiter informed us that he was brand new and didn't know much of the menu or the wine selection. He also pointed out on each trip back to our table that nobody was assisting him as he was learning. I'll point out here that for whatever reason he was not our waiter by the end of our meal.\n\nWe got the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, Thracian Clay Pot, Chicken Soup, Chebureki, Bacon wrapped dates and the Beef and Lamb Confit. We were really interested in the Thracian Clay Pot as it was recently featured on a Food Network show.\n\nThe Stroganoff was ladled over wild mushroom plemeni, a kind of Russian tortellini. This stroganoff had a lot of creamy goodness but was completely lacking the meat.\n\nI'll get to the Thracian Clay Pot shortly. The Chicken Soup was desired by my kids ages 8 and 6, as well as the bacon wrapped dates. The chicken soup was quite chunky with big chicken flavor. The first round of dates looked like they spent about 1 minute too long in the pan where one side was cooked good the other burnt. We were informed that the cook likes to cook it that way to which our reply was, \""""Please give us unburned bacon wrapped dates.\"""" They were very good about getting this order back after the rest of our items had come out.\n\nThe Chebureki was akin to a samosa where it is a flattened dough item filled with something and deep fried in this case, a delicious meat filling and topped with some dill and chopped scallions. Fairly standard in flavor and not served with any type of dipping sauce.\n\nThe Beef and Lamb Confit was tender and tasty served atop a small scoop of a dill and scallion rice. While this was tasty it was not a distinct one. My son said, \""""Is this corned beef?\"""" And you know what? He was right. It did taste a lot like the type of corned beef I'd find in a chunky hash at Hash House a go-go. But that's for another review.\n\nSo now back to the Thracian Clay Pot. It would seem that during the shuffling of waiters for our table, either our waiter put in this order incorrectly or it was given to another table because we didn't get it during the course of them bringing the rest of our order. When we questioned why the long wait, we were told that it takes a while. We didn't get it after an hour after initially ordering and 30 minutes after reordering it. So I can't tell you how melty and delicious it looked and how it would taste, but the table next to us seemed to really enjoy it.\n\nI'm not a vodka drinker so please read the other ratings for their extensive vodka menu.\n\nThis still doesn't really warrant the low rating based on the food. Where it really lacked was the overall experience now versus where it was. This place used to have people who knew the food, wasn't afraid to give locals some food they couldn't pronounce and keep true to themselves. Now, there are waitstaff that don't know the product and don't make you feel excited about their food.\n\nIf your looking for something new in Vegas and haven't been, your experience will most likely be 4-5 stars. It is not something that you will find anywhere else and that makes it unique. You will not have the displeasure of seeing a restaurant jump the shark.","On the whole, this restaurant does give a new patron a great slice of  European cuisine and it is worth noting that if you've never been here before that you should try it out because most of the food as it is now is delicious, but having been here in the past and knowing what these foods really were has really soured my experience.\n\nIt's been a long time since I had been back to this place since its first inception.

This is incredible.\n\nCevape\n-Homemade fat finger sized sausages served with lepina, a type of yeasty flatbread.\n\nArtisian Charcuterie Plate/Cheese Plate\n-These 2 are definite musts for light eating and drinks\n\nLeskovacka pljeskavica\n-similar to the cevape in flavor but served like an over sized burger\n\nThere were also a few kabob-like meats and a few other sausages similar to the cevape that were so delicious.\n\nSo why the <font color = green>tenuous</font> rating? Mostly due to the fact that what I described is what I was hoping to find on this most recent visit today.\n\nOur waiter informed us that he was brand new and didn't know much of the menu or the wine selection. He also pointed out on each trip back to our table that nobody was assisting him as he was learning. I'll point out here that for whatever reason he was not our waiter by the end of our meal.\n\nWe got the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, Thracian Clay Pot, Chicken Soup, Chebureki, Bacon wrapped dates and the Beef and Lamb Confit. We were really interested in the Thracian Clay Pot as it was recently featured on a Food Network show.\n\nThe Stroganoff was ladled over wild mushroom plemeni, a kind of Russian tortellini. This stroganoff had a lot of creamy goodness but was completely lacking the meat.\n\nI'll get to the Thracian Clay Pot shortly. The Chicken Soup was desired by my kids ages 8 and 6, as well as the bacon wrapped dates. The chicken soup was quite chunky with big chicken flavor. The first round of dates looked like they spent about 1 minute too long in the pan where one side was cooked good the other burnt. We were informed that the cook likes to cook it that way to which our reply was, \""""Please give us unburned bacon wrapped dates.\"""" They were very good about getting this order back after the rest of our items had come out.\n\nThe Chebureki was akin to a samosa where it is a flattened dough item filled with something and deep fried in this case, a delicious meat filling and topped with some dill and chopped scallions. Fairly standard in flavor and not served with any type of dipping sauce.\n\nThe Beef and Lamb Confit was tender and tasty served atop a small scoop of a dill and scallion rice. While this was tasty it was not a distinct one. My son said, \""""Is this corned beef?\"""" And you know what? He was right. It did taste a lot like the type of corned beef I'd find in a chunky hash at Hash House a go-go. But that's for another review.\n\nSo now back to the Thracian Clay Pot. It would seem that during the shuffling of waiters for our table, either our waiter put in this order incorrectly or it was given to another table because we didn't get it during the course of them bringing the rest of our order. When we questioned why the long wait, we were told that it takes a while. We didn't get it after an hour after initially ordering and 30 minutes after reordering it. So I can't tell you how melty and delicious it looked and how it would taste, but the table next to us seemed to really enjoy it.\n\nI'm not a vodka drinker so please read the other ratings for their extensive vodka menu.\n\nThis still doesn't really warrant the low rating based on the food. Where it really lacked was the overall experience now versus where it was. This place used to have people who knew the food, wasn't afraid to give locals some food they couldn't pronounce and keep true to themselves. Now, there are waitstaff that don't know the product and don't make you feel excited about their food.\n\nIf your looking for something new in Vegas and haven't been, your experience will most likely be 4-5 stars. It is not something that you will find anywhere else and that makes it unique. You will not have the displeasure of seeing a restaurant jump the shark.",0.0011715292930603027,0.9705281257629395,0,1,0,7,"Successful"

"I had a wonderful casual dinner with my father here.\nThe bottle of Ruffino Chianti (Riserva Ducale Oro) I chose is their store was opened right away, though I felt it needed at least an hour to breathe (in order to enjoy properly), which was unfortunate since we wanted to enjoy it with dinner. I asked if they offered decanters (in order to expedite that process)  to go with big reds such as this, but sadly they didn't... \n\n*I was also disappointed to find out that the wine I purchased was not in fact under a sale price (which I believed was a $35 discount), I realized this after I saw the price which I paid was the same as at Total Wine. So in fact besides the $10 corking fee which was understood, the $45 paid for the wine was not a discounted price, but in fact a regular price.\n\nThe service here is incredibly personable. Osvoldo was a fantastic and attentive server. The owner Dennis, even came to our table to greet us near the end of our meal, and sent over some complimentary dessert.\n\nThe food was so divine though, I ordered the Pesto Gnocchi topped with melted mozzarella, which was thick and creamy. It was in fact so heavy, I was only abl to eat 1/4 of it; not a problem as my fiance devoured my leftovers when I got home :) My father had been to La Scala the night before and commented how my Gnocchi was better than the one he ordered there.\n\nMy father had the Ceasar Salad; a large spectacular portion. No anchovies though :(\n\nThe Beef Carpaccio was pretty disappointing, but not enough to keep us from eating it. \n\nAs we left, Dennis made a wonderful gesture in saying Goodbye.

"We tried The Turf for breakfast this weekend.  We were definitely not in the mood to wait a lifetime for Matt's after perusing the market, so we decided to head over to the Turf.

Our server was very nice, and I am pretty sure we had her on our first night here.  After explaining to us what black and white pudding was, ewww, and then running away, she came back for our breakfast order.  I got the Bacon and Cheese Omelet and the husband got Biscuits and Gravy.  My breakfast was served with hashbrowns and toast.  The hashbrowns were thin and crispy, just the way I like it.

"Gather around intrepid sightseers and <font color = red>let</font> me tell you a little story about Papillion Grand Canyon tours. \n\nIt all began at the buttcrack of dawn one tepid Thursday in October as a grotesquely obese bus driver beckoned us into her flatulent world before accosting <font color = red>bewildered</font> tourists from all over the Las Vegas strip with the importance of common sense bus protocols. We were also warned a grand total of 7 times in 25 minutes not to get comfortable because we would be changing buses again shortly which was ironic because the seats appeared to be made from repurposed potato sacks and were every bit as itchy.\n\nWith warm water bottle in hand and mild rash on leg, we were corralled into a stark labyrinth of a building where instruction on how the people with green stickers should enter the green line and people with red stickers should enter the red line lasted inordinately long. Because it was clear that some of the group spoke no English, we were then subjected to that feeble and oft <font color = red>insulting</font> tactic where we were spoken to as if we might be near deaf imbeciles. As if speaking slowly at high volume and dumbing down ones vocabulary and sentence structure has somehow ever caused a person to spontaneously comprehend English or has ever bridged any language barrier at all.\n\nAfter a lot of bad noise, we were given a generic juice box, a rubbery danish and access to a foul cauldron of coffee-like fluid. We then boarded another bus where we were entertained by the musings of a large man named Walter as we made the long trek to the Grand Canyon... museum. \n\nUpon arrival at this pitiful <font color = red>tourist</font> <font color = red>trap</font> we noticed sheriffs and other authorities were swarming the area due to a fistfight that had just been broken up. After seeing the interior of this \""""museum\"""" I would share a profound <font color = red>empathy</font> for the violent men that <font color = red>preceded</font> me. The museum consisted of a dozen or so framed pictures of the Grand Canyon followed by an appalling <font color = red>restroom</font> with backed up plumbing, a stuffed mountain lion type beast and two large piles of overpriced Doritos.\n\nWith that nonsense behind us, we traversed the remaining dirt road to the helipad of awesomeness where a blond chopper pilot (who was pretty easy on the eyes I'll have you know) swooped and wove us through the picturesque hole in the ground we came so far to see. However, no sooner had this thrilling ride concluded did we realize what was in store for us at the bottom of the canyon.\n\nAs altitude and standards began to plummet in perfect synchronicity, it was time to forge the Colorado River on a guided pontoon tour that's worthlessness cannot be overstated. As far as our tour guide, it wasn't so much that English wasn't his second or third language that pissed me off, it was that English wasn't a language at all for him. He briefly became useful when it became apparent that our boat was going to stall every 8 or 9 seconds of the tour. On the plus side, he did save quite a bit of fuel by allowing us to helplessly drift backwards for the vast majority of the tour while jabbering incoherently and demanding to take pictures of us with our own cameras. At this point it was obvious that we were not going to travel more than 100 yards in either direction from the dock. Because the other pontoon tour companies zooming past us down the river were not able to create a wake large enough to mercifully capsize our boat, we had to wait out this infuriating charade.\n\nOur return helicopter ride did much to ease the lingering anger and despair. This time around we had a new helicopter with a squeaky clean bald head and a beard that inspired the kind of confidence you'd need if he were flying you on a black ops mission in Beirut. \n\nHe brought us safely back to the top of the west rim where we were given a ticket to get a free (and I use the term loosely) lunch. It was less alarming that we were served prison food for lunch than the fact that we were served by what appeared to be actual inmates. Although I remained nauseous and slipped in and out of consciousness the rest of our souvenir saturated trip, I do remember getting a solid two and a half hours of life coaching and financial advice from our bus driver that included evidence that he continues to fall victim to the Gambler's Fallacy even after losing his meager life savings time and time again, as well as numerous thinly veiled requests for a tip. Hopefully all of that was just the food causing me to hallucinate but we may never know for certain.\n\nAll in all I cannot recommend this tour company. While the helicopter tour was a huge ramekin of awesomesauce, it is admittedly something that is hard to screw up providing you don't crash and die a fiery death (in which case we should assume yours would have been only a 1 star review).

Why charge me for something that I don't use?!?!). The internet part sucked considering I needed wifi for my iphone so all weekend it was hard to pick up a decent signal. Also there was no coffee pot or mini fridge which can be found in you average Marriott hotel nowadays, but for a luxury hotel on the strip... I <font color = green>believing</font> those were not <font color = green>reconsidered</font> basic needs which caused us to eat at their food court and spend even more money.\n\nTHE UGLY: the elevator was horrible. It was very rickety and caused my husband and I to topple into other people while in there. The back door of our hotel bathroom was covered with <font color = green>shaded</font> finger smudges and a few red smears of goodness knows what. I had to wipe the door down before I felt clean enough to use it. Our room towels were really grungy and needed to be replaced. My husband forgot a comb so we called the front desk and they <font color = green>destiny</font> us to their 24/7 store where we HAD to buy one at $5. Seriously?!?!

In <font color = green>comparison</font> to the more <font color = green>famous</font> <font color = green>Sterling</font> Brunch across the Strip at Bally's, many people aren't aware that on Sunday, Jasmine in the Bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe, Cantonese/dim sum/all American breakfast brunch. The room is decorated in florals and creams... it's a bit <font color = green>old</font> lady, but never <font color = green>feels</font> stuffy, especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning. Better yet, the room's floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Bellagio fountains, which go into overdrive <font color = green>especially</font> for brunch patrons. Fountain music is <font color = green>pumped</font> into the room every 15 minutes as the <font color = green>fountains</font> <font color = green>perform</font>. \n\nOutside of the fountains, the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet. It's not <font color = green>massive</font>, but there's a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes. Traditional american brunch favorites are here, with the usual Bellagio-classy <font color = green>twists</font>: the belgian waffles are red velvet, the eggs benedict are served on a lobster-potato cake. There's an <font color = green>excellent</font> raw bar, a selection of caviar and sushi, and awesome cold <font color = green>bites</font> and cheeses.There's also an omelet <font color = green>station</font>, but a better choice is the soup, where a chef customizes asian-style noodles to your liking. The carving station has huge chunks of beef, lamb, and incredible <font color = green>carved</font> slab bacon. The dim sum <font color = green>components</font> are <font color = green>great</font> too: <font color = green>sui</font> mai, short ribs, crystal prawns. Best of all, they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns. \n\nThe finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts, and unlike many buffets, these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good. Additionally, the <font color = green>pastry</font> chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts, what was particularly good that day, and what ice creams and gelatos they've prepared. \n\nDownsides: it's not cheap ($80ish), and unlimited champagne is an add-on. (They have different levels of sparkling wines, and I <font color = green>believe</font> the lowest was about $15?) I <font color = green>think</font> they add gratuity automatically, but the service was so good when I went that my boyfriend and I ended up tipping more. \n\nOverall, this is a truly not-to-be-missed morning in Las Vegas.

While I wouldn't say that the food <font color = green>tends</font> to arrive quickly, I've always had good service (even with the group of 12), nice recommendations, and good advice on ingredients or substitutions when I've asked. I don't eat red meat, so that's always appreciated.\n\nWhile it gets <font color = green>loud</font> at busy times (and it does get busy), I like the industrial/bistro atmosphere, and especially the view over the lake. Ask for a table near the lake windows (or, when it's warm, the outside tables!) for a bit more <font color = green>intimacy</font>. There's a wide selection of beers and wines, including reasonably priced and quite good house wines, and some lovely specialty cocktails.\n\nFor appetizers, I've recently ordered the picollo fritto and the cheese plate. Recent <font color = green>unexpected</font> favorites among the picollo fritto items have been fennel and lemon. The cheese plate had a nice variety of cheeses, many of them local -- cheddar, blue, chevre, etc -- as well as fruit and a unexpectedly delish vegan \""""salami\"""" made out of figs and nuts. I had salad and fish for dinner on both of my recent visits (the salmon once and the mahi mahi once), and both were <font color = green>fresh</font>, grilled nicely, and <font color = green>clearly</font> served quickly. Well marinated, hot, moist, and flaky. The lentils that came with the salmon were a bit on the salty side, but the bok choy & fennel with the mahi were a lovely sweet-and-sour complement. Yum. My husband is a <font color = green>fan</font> of their cassoulet and their steak (although, warning, the steak does come with both frites and butter). Overall, their fish <font color = green>seems</font> reliably <font color = green>great</font>, but I haven't been <font color = green>thrilled</font> with their pastas when I've tried them in the past. The orechiette sauce, for instance, is oily and a bit too <font color = green>heavy</font> on the garlic and olives, which overwhelms the broccoli rabe and tomatoes. Sad, because I adore a good broccoli rabe. As far as desserts, I've tried a bunch of different items, all good. The chocolate cake and the sorbets (rotating, often in unusual flavors like olive oil or buttermilk) are favorites.\n\nSo: while I wouldn't say that everything is fabulous at Sardine (hence the 4 stars), there are a lot of very good options. It's a nice place with a good vibe, accommodating of large or small groups, and definitely on my Madison favorites list. It's worth the trip (or a few!).","I've been a fan of Sardine for both brunch and dinner for awhile, and just ended up there twice in quick <font color = red>legacy</font>.

"I have seen all of the Vegas Cirque Du Soleil <font color = green>shows</font> and this is my <font color = green>favorite</font> one.  I <font color = green>love</font> that there are speakers in the headrests - that extra base and surround sound environment really makes you feel more aware of what is going on in the show.  I love when the speakers pick up the shooting arrows.  It <font color = green>sounds</font> so awesome - like they are zooming by your ears.  The music is also really cool - lots of drums and even a heavy metal electric guitar song.\n\nThe stage feels like a futuristic Matrix or Mad Max environment.  This is a <font color = green>saga</font> about a royal brother and sister that get separated when marauding tribesmen kill their parents during a summer festival.  There is a distinct Asian theme to this cirque.  The tribes people are tattooed like Hawaiians or the Yakuza, there is a Kabuki looking evil lord, and lots of Chinese style acrobatics.  The boy is guarded by the main family warrior who is this yoked shirtless hottie cakes with dreadlocks and a spear.  The girl is guarded by their overweight big breasted nanny and some clowns.  \n\nThe stage is a 360 degree revolving platform that moves horizontally and <font color = green>vertically</font>.  The floor at several points is the wall.  There is this one scene where they are at the beach and then the beach turns into the wall and a zillion pounds of sand slides off of it along with one of the clowns who drops about 30 feet down.  There is another scene where the stage is <font color = green>supposed</font> to be a mountain and the girl and her entourage is trying to climb to the top to escape the evil peeps.  As they are climbing up the wall there are evil people shooting arrows at them from the audience which in turn makes pegs pop out of the wall to simulate arrows sticking out of the wall.  The climbers swing in really pretty circles around the pegs.  The girl gets to the top and is sheltered by these Mongolian looking people.  It is now winter.  \n\nMeanwhile the boy and his stud warrior guardian hang out and make really <font color = green>cool</font> shadow puppets.  They subsequently get caught by the tribesmen and get put in <font color = green>wheel</font> shaped cages.  In the process there are a couple of other scenes including this one where guys are running and jumping rope on the outside of these hamster wheels that are revolving like a Ferris wheel about 30 feet in the air.  That may be the best acrobatics scene in the whole show.  While in captivity, the boy falls in love with the tribes' princess, who looks a little butch.  She releases him so that he can find his sister and then she does a cool baton twirling dance.  \n\nThe sister also falls in love with some dude in that sheer Britney Spears outfit with the little diamonds all over it and a red thong and they flirt with each other while flying around the stage from one of those hanging sheets.  Visually it is really pretty, but the dude looks like he might be a little light in the loafers with his long flowing hair and rhinestone outfit.\n\nI don't know how the brother and the sister reunite, but they do and they regroup and go to war against the evil Kabuki lord with the help of the tribes' princess' troops.  I forgot to mention that somewhere along the way the boy rescues the princess' dad from being captured by Kabuki face.  The bad people that tried to capture the boy and the girl are now on their side.  They go to war; the stage is again a wall and of course they win, get their kingdom back and the boy and the girl get married and all of the costumes are really pretty. \n\nSome other cool scenes include a boat on the stormy waters, an insect inspired rain forest act with swinging acrobats, and a flying contraption made to look like a bird that is operated by 5 people.

"I must say... I was really <font color = red>looking</font> <font color = red>forward</font> to having dinner here.

When we checked in with reception, we were informed that we would have a 10mn wait to be seated outside.\n\n\""""10mn ? Not a problem !\"""", I said, and continued on to state that we would grab a drink at the bar and sit outside to take a look at the view, while we waited to be seated in the dining area.\n\nAnd we waited.

I am impressed with the ease of getting an appointment!   \n\nAlso, when I walked in I liked that the office is clean and tastefully decorated with a good selection of reading materials, having both men and women's magazines.  (Not that I needed them though, because they whisked me straight back almost as soon as I sat down.)   \n\nThe exam/treatment areas have TVs on the wall so you can distract yourself with what's on TV.

The dentist, Dr. Barela, was <font color = green>warm</font> and friendly and never left me waiting for him to come see me.

Why yes, please, thank you!  \n\nHe was <font color = green>ready</font> to do the filling within minutes and he was super gentle and friendly.  He explained everything as he did the filling too, so I wasn't left there wondering what was going on the whole time.  Believe me, the whole process was PAINLESS.   While he was in there he also added some anti-sensitivity medicine to a couple of teeth that were a bit sensitive (but good otherwise) and he grinded down a high spot on a crown that I got a year ago that never did feel quite right.

So I am sure this is the same for any poor student that don't drive or drive a student car, your options are pretty limited, and you will have made the mistake of visiting Pho 68 like 3-5 years ago or earlier.  <font color = green>Chances</font> are you will not go back again because the soup is <font color = green>bland</font>, artifically sweet due to a lot of msg and the color of cloudy water with a few slices of meat.  \n\nBut like I mentioned, as of last year, a friend tipped us off on the change in chef or boss there and the pho is very good.  so, we trust our friend and she was right :)  She may not be vietnamese but she is in the food industry and shes right that it has come 180 from before.  So come here and order the Pho, with spring rolls and an ice coffee.  U will like it, your <font color = green>stomach</font> will thank u for it and when you are done, go thru the sidedoor to lee lee and go buy some groceries that are <font color = green>foreign</font> and whose name you cannot pronounce, but still are tempted to try anyway :)  Oh, the boss here is very laid back and friendly and will recognize u if he sees U for a second time that same week.  He is usually a one man operation and can be a little slow, but don't fret, its gonna get here, just keep your eyes on the tv in the middle and be confused at what they are singing about :)  Most of the soup noodles are pretty decent, I had tried several different ones, the regular pho, seafood broth ones, tomatoe broth one and the spicy hue style ones.  I don't know if the rice plates are good, but the spring rolls are decent too.  \n\nSo if u are in chandler and craving pho, u know where to go :)  let me know if u know of any place better, i am always interested to try ;)","Like Pho Nat in Tempe, this place used to be in business because of their convenient location, next to Lee Lee.  \n\nAs of some time middle of last year, I guess either there is a new boss or chef, but right now this is my go to place for Vietnamese Pho if I am in Chandler area.

"My mom stayed at their new facility off of tenaya next to mountainview Hospital in North Las Vegas.

We paid them thinking we would be getting some rehab every day. The weekends are really lax.. you might get some time, you might not. They try to increase the rehab time during the week so the AVERAGE rehab time carries them through the weekend.  That looks great on paper, but when a patient comes here for rehab to get well, and the patient and family is expecting daily rehab, that was not given! the money paid on the weekend is the same as during the week.. seems like a bit of a <font color = red>rip</font> off..\n\nThings I've noticed toward the end of her stay.. when she called for a nurse to help her, the time seemed to have gotten longer.. I went to the nurse's station to see what is taking so long, and saw one of the head nurses doing makeup, giving another nurse a flu shot or something, but it seemed like they were joking around .. unprofessional!! it almost seemed like I was being so bothersome to them asking them to attend to the call that my mom made for assistance.  In the end, that nurse didn't even come, she sent someone else to go see my mom.\n\nLastly, and this is the most important for people who are thinking about going there, when we were leaving the facility, I asked for all the meds we gave them prescriptions for. They said they can't dispense it to us. (I did see cards of 30 day meds for my mom) If they can't dispense it to us, and they accepted our prescriptions, WHAT do they do with the extra medicine?\n\nI had to go to the pharmacy that evening to get the meds she needed. The pharmacy did not have her <font color = red>blood</font> pressure medication on hand, so it would be Monday until they could get it. (it was friday).. I called the facility back to see if they can just give me 3 to cover her for the weekend, and they once again said they can't dispense.. but I asked them again, what do they do with the medicine that they received with OUR prescription, and she yelled out to someone to ask what they do with the medicine, and she responded that she/they didn't know..\n\nIt seems really fishy to me.. medicine that was prescribed for my mom, should be my mom's.. it can't get reused for another patient?! maybe they're dealing on the side?

"Cashed in on the Expedia save $300 deal and got a flight from LAX to Vegas and 1-night at the Wynn (+$100 resort credit for food/bev) for $1.63. Yep, you read that correctly...1 dollar, 63 cents.\n\nThe hotel itself wasnt too crowded for holiday season. Check-in was smooth and painless. I was able to check-in at 9AM, even though the listed time is 3PM. Very convenient!\n\nI stayed in a Deluxe Panoramic View room on the \""""59th\"""" floor. Really I think its the 49th since the elevator skips 10 floor numbers. Not sure whats going on there. The rooms are pretty nice and definitely have a luxurious feel. The decor was okay, not really my style. No complaints at all about the room. The room controls are actually pretty cool. Make you you press \""""ALL ON\"""" when you walk into the room. Most reno's on the strip are adding those features.\n\nThe Terrace Pointe Cafe at the Wynn is pretty good. The Sangria was reasonably priced and delicious.The Mahi Mahi Tacos were awesome! Not too filling which was good since we were hitting the buffet later on.\n\nThe Wynn Buffet is one of the best on the strip. I still think the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort Spa Casino in Henderson beats the Wynn's buffet hands down (and its cheaper). Check it out.\n\nThe 24-hour cafe is way overpriced. I got a Turkey/Brie sandwich for $10.50 which was smaller than a Subway 6\"""". I'm glad it was on the Wynn's tab.\n\nMy group showed up to Blush lounge a little late (11, 11:30) and they tried to charge us full price ($30 guys, $20 girls) as hotel guests. Shady..no <font color = green>thanks</font>. We took off and went to club Moon at the Palms and had an great time!\n\nOverall, my stay was <font color = green>great</font>. Free food, free room, free trip! My total at checkout after the resort fee was about $40. However, I probably wouldn't stay here on my next trip. I'll probably checkout the newer properties like Aria and the Cosmopolitan. Props to anyone else that got on that expedia deal!","Cashed in on the Expedia save $300 deal and got a flight from LAX to Vegas and 1-night at the Wynn (+$100 resort credit for food/bev) for $1.63. Yep, you read that correctly...1 dollar, 63 cents.\n\nThe hotel itself wasnt too crowded for holiday season. Check-in was smooth and painless. I was able to check-in at 9AM, even though the listed time is 3PM. Very convenient!\n\nI stayed in a Deluxe Panoramic View room on the \""""59th\"""" floor. Really I think its the 49th since the elevator skips 10 floor numbers. Not sure whats going on there. The rooms are pretty nice and definitely have a luxurious feel. The decor was okay, not really my style. No complaints at all about the room. The room controls are actually pretty cool. Make you you press \""""ALL ON\"""" when you walk into the room. Most reno's on the strip are adding those features.\n\nThe Terrace Pointe Cafe at the Wynn is pretty good. The Sangria was reasonably priced and delicious.The Mahi Mahi Tacos were awesome! Not too filling which was good since we were hitting the buffet later on.\n\nThe Wynn Buffet is one of the best on the strip. I still think the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort Spa Casino in Henderson beats the Wynn's buffet hands down (and its cheaper). Check it out.\n\nThe 24-hour cafe is way overpriced. I got a Turkey/Brie sandwich for $10.50 which was smaller than a Subway 6\"""". I'm glad it was on the Wynn's tab.\n\nMy group showed up to Blush lounge a little late (11, 11:30) and they tried to charge us full price ($30 guys, $20 girls) as hotel guests. Shady..no <font color = red>acknowledgement</font>. We took off and went to club Moon at the Palms and had an great time!\n\nOverall, my stay was <font color = red>wondrous</font>.

"It's not fair to Raku that I come from California.  My exposure to and experience with izakaya restaurants is varied enough that I know 5 star fare when I eat it and Raku is close--so very close--but lost points on service and price.\n\nThe kobe beef tendon and grilled duck with balsamic soy sauce sold out.  It was 7:30PM on a Monday night and the place is open until 3AM.  Since we were severely disappointed, the waitress pushed the specials of the evening on us.\n\nWe ordered the bluefin tuna (toro), the unagi (cooked in two styles, grilled and with salt and pepper), and the grilled salmon cheek (kama).  From the regular menu, we also got the homemade tofu served in two different ways: cold with green onions and ginger (hiyayakko) and sitting in hot broth after being fried (agedashi).  We also had the grilled pork cheek (kurobuta), a couple of chicken wings, and chicken and egg served over a bowl of rice (oyakodon).  For dessert, the green tea creme brulee.\n\nThe toro was amazing and should be the #1 reason why you come here.  It was soft, smooth, and slightly sweet, as perfectly fresh toro is supposed to taste.  $25 for 6 huge slabs?!  Yes, please!\n\nThe homemade tofu is reason #2 why I'd come back.  I prefer the agedashi style just because I prefer hot tofu over cold, but both styles were enjoyable.  I particularly liked how flavorful the broth was.\n\nThe unagi was a total rip-off.  $30 for 6 small, bony pieces.  Grilled was better than S&P but neither were things I'd order again and I strongly suggest that you don't either.\n\nThe salmon kama was okay but not something I'd order here ever again because almost every good Japanese restaurant in California makes it better and for a cheaper price.  That isn't to say it's terrible, though.  If you've NEVER had salmon kama ever and you can't get it where you're from, it doesn't hurt to try it here.\n\nThe kurobuta and chicken wings were salty, greasy, and fatty, as expected.  Would have been great with beer, which unfortunately we lacked.  I'm sure we would have had a better experience with the meat had we ordered something like the foie gras or a kobe beef item.\n\nThe oyako (which means 'parent' and 'child', referring to the chicken and egg, respectively) is classic Japanese comfort food and I loved it.  Tender chicken pieces nestled in a bowl of warm, soft rice that's gooey from egg yolk made this reason #3 why I'd come back.  For some, this dish is about as special as fried rice, but if you love both as much as I do, I'd recommend getting it!\n\nLastly, the green tea creme brulee was mediocre but come on, you don't go to a place like this for a fabulous dessert.  Try Nobu or a French or Italian restaurant if you want a dessert that will knock your socks off.\n\nNow let me talk about the sub-par service.  We ordered tea (which, surprise surprise, cost us $) but the waitresses rarely refilled our tea no matter how many times we asked.  And when they did, they'd refill it 1/4th of the way.  The tea, by the way, is roasted green tea and is amazing so I suggest ordering it even if you do end up getting sake or beer.  But know your rights--don't be afraid to ask for more and demand that they refill it!  That's what you're paying for, after all!\n\nAnother waitress also charged us an extra $50 out of sheer stupidity.  When we discovered the discrepancy between the amount listed on the bill and the amount we were charged, she tried to defend herself by saying the restaurant was too dark.  Try going to a lighted area, then?  A bill isn't something you 'guess'...if you have a question about what is written, ask us.  Sigh.\n\nWith all this said, Raku is as good as a non-sushi Japanese restaurant as you will find in Sin City and an eye-opening experience for people who think Japanese cuisine is all sushi and sashimi.  Bottom line: if you're in Vegas, this is a must-try.","It's not fair to Raku that I come from California.

My date enjoyed everything he had and he had two of the cocktails, their signature drinks that I can't remember the name of and they were both wonderful.

"THE GOOD:\nBurgers, fries and drinks were really good.  I <font color = red>loved</font> the variety of burger selections and 3 types of french fries to choose from.  They also have specialty drinks that we really enjoyed.  \n\nTHE <font color = red>BAD</font>:\nWe came for the first time and there were 5 of us in our party.  Bill came to $195 for burgers, fries and drinks. Yea.... I think the fries should come with the burger considering the price.  Most specialty drinks are $10-14 on average.  The waitress was VERY sweet, however, we waited FOREVER for our food.  There were MANY people working but we looked around the room and we saw many tables that were just sitting there and waiting... waiting.  They even had the manager (big dude in a suit) walking around serving people.  When we were finally done, we waited for <font color = red>roughly</font> 23 minutes just to get our check and credit card back from the waitress.  Mind you, the original waitress we had was nice but then she went on a break.  Another person relieved her but we never saw that person the entire rest of the meal.  Considering the amount of people working, there is zero <font color = red>reason</font> to wait so long just for a <font color = red>check</font>.  <font color = red>Bogus</font>.  Probably won't <font color = red>return</font> for that fact alone, no matter how good the food was.","THE GOOD:\nBurgers, fries and drinks were really good.
