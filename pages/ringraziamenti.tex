% Maybe you were initially sceptical about my choice of career, but I hope that now you are proud of me. 
% I will be always on your side, be present for you whenever you need me, but now it's time to start my own life and put into practice everything that you also taught me.\\

% \noindent Thirdly, infinitely thanks to the person who knows me the most, Gaia. Thanks for being my lover, my soulmate, my constant, my partner in crime, my partner in life, my everything. You have countless merits, but although patience is not one of them, you have always put up with my stressful moments during the last two years and more. No words are enough to express my love and gratitude for you.

% \noindent And least but not last, I would list all the people who have been with me during my studies, who have shared with me the pleasant moments, who have supported me and who have always been there for me.

% My little brother, Fabri, I saw you growing up faster than me. I'm proud of you, the person you are becoming. Whatever you need, whenever you need it, I will be there for you. I will always be your big brother, love ya. 

% Gianluca, partner of a thousand adventures, in recent years we built a friendship that I'm sure will last forever. I know no one more than you who is loyal, sincere, who gives his soul to the people you care about. I know that you are a person who is always ready to help, to give a hand, to give advice. I know I can always count on you, as you can always count on me. The best is yet to come, it awaits us.

% Michele, how many years have we been friends? We grew up together, we shared the same classes, we have always been there for each other. Time has passed, but our friendship has not changed. No matter how far we are, I'm always up to help you. Distance means so little, when someone means so much.

% Salvo, we randomly started this journey together, but day by day, we became more than just university colleagues. Groupmate in almost every project, friend of long bullshitting video calls, I'm glad I met you and for sure this friendship will be long-lasting.

% Simmy, the time spent in Erasmus would not have been the same without you. Although we met for the first time in Amsterdam, we were in complete sync with everything. As you already know, you taught me a lot during those six unforgettable months and I admire you for the person you are. This amazing duo could get back together in the future, who knows!

% Simone and Behnam, my homies, I have beautiful memories of our time together in the 208 flat. A lot of fun, a lot of bullshit, a lot of gin tonic and negroni. I hope we will meet again soon, maybe in a different place, but wherever it will be, we will cook again together tahdig and carbonara.

% Xiaowei, Davide and Eric, even though we only met a few months ago, it's with you that I spent the funniest moments here in Bologna. I'm looking forward to see all of us graduated and celebrate properly as we already did for the first “doctor”.

% Fabrizio, thank you for our long talks about super-fancy scientific stuff, but also about personal references and dreams. Keep up the good work, I'm sure you will be great at whatever you wanna do. Let's see what the future hold for us.

% Francesco, everything started with “do you know the history of Leo Messi?”, and now here we are. You are the person I wanna call whenever I'm upset, since with your humour I can always bring back the mood. After Amsterdam and Bologna, the next step is Milan. Are you ready to scrounge up a bed there too?

% Paki, Eddy and Marco, I'm grateful for the thousand funny evenings spent together, especially during the last summers. Thank you for easing my stressful moments under exams with your overwhelming cheerfulness.

% Nico and Mauro, truly friends whom I'm happy to have met during my bachelor studies. Since then, we always kept in touch and you both have stimulated in me the passion for this subject. Thanks to Nico for the pleasant long calls that always began with “tu ste buën”. Thanks to Mauro, my new colleague, a new chapter is starting!
